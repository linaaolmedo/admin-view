# Dashboard Requirements: Claims Analytics Charts

## 1 & 2. Claims Processing Performance Over Time

**Purpose**: Monitor both claims volume distribution and processing speed to understand overall system performance and identify optimization opportunities.

**Key Data**: Monthly claims by status, average processing time per stage, completion rates, processing velocity metrics across 12+ months.

**Key Insights**:
- **Processing Health**: Shows relationship between volume spikes and processing delays
- **Efficiency Trends**: Tracks whether claims move faster or slower through the system over time
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identifies which stages slow down during high-volume periods
- **Performance Correlation**: Reveals how volume affects quality and speed

**Value**: Provides comprehensive view for strategic planning, enables proactive resource management, identifies when process improvements are needed, and supports realistic timeline setting.

## 4. Monthly Claims Volume Trends

**Purpose**: Analyze monthly claims processing patterns to understand workload fluctuations and business trends.

**Key Data**: Total monthly claims processed, volume by claim type, seasonal variations, growth patterns over time.

**Key Insights**:
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Identifies predictable high and low volume periods
- **Business Growth**: Shows whether claims volume is trending up or down
- **Workload Distribution**: Reveals uneven distribution that may require planning
- **Forecasting Data**: Provides baseline for predicting future volume needs

**Value**: Enables proactive staffing for peak periods, supports business planning decisions, helps identify growth opportunities, and provides data for operational budgeting.

## 5. Practitioner Performance Analysis

**Purpose**: Evaluate individual practitioner effectiveness to identify high performers, training opportunities, and workload optimization.

**Key Data**: Claims completed per practitioner, approval rates, processing speed, quality scores, and comparative performance metrics.

**Key Insights**:
- **Performance Gaps**: Identifies practitioners who may need additional training or support
- **Best Practice Models**: Highlights successful approaches from top performers
- **Workload Equity**: Shows whether work is fairly distributed across the team
- **Skill Development**: Reveals specific areas where practitioners excel or struggle

**Value**: Supports targeted coaching and training, enables fair performance evaluations, helps optimize team assignments, and identifies mentorship opportunities.

## 6. Claims Financial Impact Analysis

**Purpose**: Track the monetary value of claims processing to understand revenue patterns and financial risks.

**Key Data**: Total claim values by status, approved vs. rejected amounts, revenue realization timelines, and financial loss from rejections.

**Key Insights**:
- **Revenue Visibility**: Shows actual and potential revenue from claims processing
- **Financial Risk**: Quantifies money at risk from pending or problematic claims
- **Loss Analysis**: Identifies financial impact of rejected or delayed claims
- **Payment Patterns**: Reveals timing and consistency of revenue realization

**Value**: Supports accurate financial forecasting, helps prioritize high-value claims, enables risk management decisions, and provides data for budget planning.

## 7. Claims Aging Analysis

**Purpose**: Monitor how long claims spend in each processing stage to prevent delays and ensure timely completion.

**Key Data**: Age distribution of claims by status, aging categories (0-7, 8-14, 15-30, 31+ days), overdue claims, and processing deadlines.

**Key Insights**:
- **Delay Identification**: Highlights claims that have been stalled too long
- **Priority Management**: Shows which claims need immediate attention
- **Process Efficiency**: Indicates overall speed of claims movement
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies claims approaching deadline or timeout limits

**Value**: Prevents revenue loss from expired claims, improves customer service through faster processing, enables better workload prioritization, and supports compliance with processing requirements.
