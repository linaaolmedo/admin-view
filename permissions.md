# KIDS Dashboard - Permissions and Access Control Documentation

## 1. Executive Summary

The KIDS Dashboard implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system designed to ensure appropriate access to sensitive student and organizational data while maintaining compliance with FERPA, HIPAA, and other educational data privacy regulations. The permission system uses a hierarchical structure with clear separation of duties across different user roles.

### Key Security Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive only the minimum permissions necessary for their role
- **Role-Based Data Isolation**: Access to data is restricted based on user role and organizational scope
- **Hierarchical Permission Inheritance**: Higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower levels
- **Audit Trail Compliance**: All permission changes and data access are logged for compliance
- **Multi-Organization Support**: Secure data isolation between different organizations

## 2. Permission System Overview

### 2.1 Account Types
The system supports three primary account types with distinct permission levels:

1. **üë§ Practitioner** - Clinical services and student management
2. **üë• Supervisor** - Oversight and approval workflows  
3. **üõ°Ô∏è Administrator** - Full system access and management

### 2.2 Permission Levels
Each role operates within specific permission boundaries:

- **Standard Permissions**: Basic service delivery and student management
- **Advanced Permissions**: Supervision, reporting, and service management
- **Full Permissions**: Complete system administration and user management

## 8. Permission Implementation Details

### 8.1 Navigation Control
The sidebar navigation is dynamically generated based on user role:

```typescript
const getVisibleNavItems = (accountType: string) => {
  switch (accountType) {
    case "administrator":
      return ["claims", "manageUsers", "manageStudents", "reports", "manageOrganizations"];
    case "supervisor":
      return ["logService", "caseload", "studentServices", "assignedPractitioners", "reports"];
    case "practitioner":
      return ["logService", "caseload", "studentServices", "reports"];
    default:
      return [];
  }
};
```

### 8.2 Permission Validation
Each page and component includes permission validation:

```typescript
interface PermissionCheck {
  hasPermission(action: string, resource: string): boolean;
  canAccess(route: string): boolean;
  canModify(dataType: string, recordId: string): boolean;
  canView(dataType: string, scope: string): boolean;
}
```

### 8.3 Data Filtering
Data access is automatically filtered based on user permissions:

```typescript
interface DataFilter {
  filterStudents(allStudents: Student[]): Student[];
  filterServices(allServices: Service[]): Service[];
  filterUsers(allUsers: User[]): User[];
  filterReports(allReports: Report[]): Report[];
}
