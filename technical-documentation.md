## 8. Permission Implementation Details

### 8.1 Navigation Control
The sidebar navigation is dynamically generated based on user role:

```typescript
const getVisibleNavItems = (accountType: string) => {
  switch (accountType) {
    case "administrator":
      return ["claims", "manageUsers", "manageStudents", "reports", "manageOrganizations"];
    case "supervisor":
      return ["logService", "caseload", "studentServices", "assignedPractitioners", "reports"];
    case "practitioner":
      return ["logService", "caseload", "studentServices", "reports"];
    default:
      return [];
  }
};
```

### 8.2 Permission Validation
Each page and component includes permission validation:

```typescript
interface PermissionCheck {
  hasPermission(action: string, resource: string): boolean;
  canAccess(route: string): boolean;
  canModify(dataType: string, recordId: string): boolean;
  canView(dataType: string, scope: string): boolean;
}
```

interface DataFilter {
  filterStudents(allStudents: Student[]): Student[];
  filterServices(allServices: Service[]): Service[];
  filterUsers(allUsers: User[]): User[];
  filterReports(allReports: Report[]): Report[];
}
